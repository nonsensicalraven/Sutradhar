Hackathon project: Sutradhar – weaving stories of Indian folk art into the digital age.
# 🎨 Sutradhar  

**Sutradhar** (सूत्रधार – *The Storyteller*) is a digital platform built during **CodeFury 8.0** to preserve, promote, and engage audiences with traditional Indian folk artforms such as **Warli**, **Madhubani**, and **Pithora**.  

Just as a *sutra* (thread) ties beads together, our platform ties together artists, their heritage, and audiences in the digital world.
