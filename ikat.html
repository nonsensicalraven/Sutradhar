      <h1>Ikat 
</h1>
<br />
      <p>
        Ikat is a resist-dyeing technique in which the pattern is created in the yarns before weaving, so the design runs through the cloth and appears on both faces. The word derives from Malay–Indonesian roots meaning “to bind,” reflecting the core method: segments of warp and/or weft threads are tightly bound to resist dye, colored in successive baths, then unbound and woven so the pre-dyed intervals interlock into motifs. Because alignment happens at the loom, ikat’s hallmark is a softly feathered or “abrash” edge where colors meet evidence of the hand’s micro-adjustments.

      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Three principal types define the grammar:

<ol>
  <li>Warp ikat: only the warp is patterned; designs read clearly along the length with weft as a ground.

</li>
<li>Weft ikat: only the weft carries pattern; motifs resolve as weaving progresses and can look slightly more diffused.
</li>
<li>Hool: tiny eyelets formed by piercing and securing the fabric.
</li>
<li>Double ikat: both warp and weft are resist-dyed to a shared diagram; when perfectly registered, complex figures snap into focus. This is rare and exceptionally labor-intensive.

</ol>
      </p>
       <br />
      <p>
        The making sequence is exacting. Artisans map a motif to a thread “graph,” bundle yarns, bind target segments with waterproof ties, dye from light to dark, and rebind for additional colors. After final rinsing and drying, bound yarns are set on the loom. During weaving, constant nudging aligns color bars pick by pick. Structures are typically plain weave or simple twills that showcase the dyed pattern without obscuring it.
      </p>
      <p>Motifs range from geometrics (diamonds, lattices, chevrons) to stylized florals, birds, and figurative panels, depending on region. Palettes span indigo, madder, turmeric, and other natural dyes to contemporary chromatics. In South Asia, notable ikat lineages include Odisha’s curvilinear bandha, Telangana’s bold Pochampally, and Gujarat’s double-ikat Patola, each with distinct scale, symmetry, and color logic.
</p><br>
<p>Quality indicators include crisp yet organic edges without bleeding, steady repeat alignment over length, saturated but even color, supple hand, and a pattern that remains legible at both distance and close inspection. At its essence, ikat is design by memory and anticipation pattern imagined in threads, revealed only when warp and weft meet.
