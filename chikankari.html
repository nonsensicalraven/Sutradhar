      <h1>Chikankari Embroidery 
</h1>
<br />
      <p>
        Chikankari is a refined hand embroidery tradition associated with Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, celebrated for ethereal whitework on fine, breathable fabrics. Originally practiced as white-on-white (shadow-like) embroidery on muslin, the craft today appears on mulmul, cotton, voile, chiffon, georgette, organza, and silk, in white or colored threads, sometimes accented with mukaish (metal dots), sequins, or beads. Its visual character is delicate, floral, and architectural creepers (bel), paisleys (kairi), jaalis (lattice), butis, and scalloped borders arranged with airy spacing that lets light and breeze pass through the cloth.

        The process typically follows a multi‑artisan chain. Designs are first transferred to fabric with temporary block-printed outlines. Needleworkers then render the pattern using a repertoire of stitches that combine flat, raised, and shadow effects. Core stitches include:

<ol>
  <li>Tepchi: a simple running stitch forming outlines or fill.
</li>
<li>Bakhiya (shadow work): herringbone on the wrong side giving a soft, shaded look on the right.
</li>
<li>Hool: tiny eyelets formed by piercing and securing the fabric.
</li>
<li>Murri and Phanda: millet- and knot-like grains for flower centers and texture.
</li>
<li>Keel, Kangan, Rahet, and Jaali: variations that create ribs, borders, and openwork resembling lace without cutting threads.
</li>
</ol>
      </p>
       <br />
      <p>
        After embroidery, pieces are carefully washed to remove print lines, then starched and finished to reveal crisp textures and translucency. Traditional motifs draw from Mughal gardens, Persianate arabesques, and local flora—rose, jasmine, bel leaves balanced by geometric jaalis inspired by architectural screens.
      </p>
      <p>Chikankari serves as everyday elegance and occasion wear alike—kurtas, saris, dupattas, lehengas, men’s kurtas, and home linens. Quality indicators include even tension, fine and consistent stitch size, clean and undistorted fabric (no puckering), sharply formed eyelets and knots, and harmonious spacing that allows the design to “breathe.” Ethical, high‑grade work uses soft, colorfast threads; stable, natural base fabrics; and preserves hand-led techniques rather than machine imitations.
</p><br>
<p>At its essence, Chikankari is embroidery as light-play: a conversation between cloth and air where shadow, transparency, and tiny textural decisions create a uniquely cool, graceful surface for the Indian climate.
