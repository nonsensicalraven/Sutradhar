      <h1>Bagh Printing 
 
</h1>
<br />
      <p>
        Bagh printing is a natural-dye, hand block-printing tradition from Bagh village in Dhar district, Madhya Pradesh. Practiced largely by Khatri printer-dyers, it is distinguished by geometric and floral repeats rendered primarily in deep black and rich red on a white or off‑white ground, with occasional khaki, mustard, and indigo accents. The craft’s identity is inseparable from its place: water from the Bagh (and nearby Baghini) river, rich in specific minerals, historically enhanced dye development and fastness, yielding a characteristic clarity and handle.

        The process follows a disciplined three-stage cycle, pre‑printing, printing, and post‑printing. Pre‑printing begins with scouring cotton or silk to remove sizing, then soaking in a traditional mixture (often including oil, natural alkaline agents, and organic additives) to improve dye affinity. Many practitioners apply a myrobalan (harad/harara) bath that imparts a pale yellow base and acts as a natural tannin mordant, setting the stage for saturated blacks and reds.

       Printing uses intricately carved teak or sheesham blocks some patterns preserved for generations to apply dye pastes. Black is typically produced by an iron acetate (ferrous sulfate and jaggery) formulation; red develops from alum mordant printed areas later dyed in alizarin/madder-based baths. Artisans build patterns in layers, aligning blocks with practiced precision so repeats lock seamlessly. A padded stone table supports the cloth; a dye reservoir and wool‑covered sieve regulate paste pickup for even impressions.
      </p>
      <p>Post‑printing involves patient resting, multiple river washes, and a critical alizarin boil with dhavdi flowers or related botanicals to develop and fix reds, after which thorough sun‑drying brightens tones and stabilizes the hand. The result is a breathable, softly lustrous fabric with excellent colorfastness.

<p>Motifs range from jaalis, paisleys, jasmine sprigs, and leheriya-inspired diagonals to designs echoing local cave murals and architectural tracery. Quality indicators include sharp outlines without bleeding, even penetration and depth of black/red, precise registration across long lengths, supple drape after finishing, and patterns that remain legible at both distance and close view. Enduring and ecological, Bagh printing synthesizes place, process, and pattern into textiles of graphic restraint and quiet radiance.
