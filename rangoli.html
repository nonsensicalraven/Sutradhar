      <h1>Rangoli 
</h1>
<br />
      <p>
      Rangoli is a traditional floor-art practice from the Indian subcontinent in which patterned designs are created at thresholds, courtyards, and places of worship to mark auspicious occasions and welcome prosperity. Typically made for festivals such as Diwali, Pongal, Onam, Ugadi, and weddings, rangoli embodies ideas of hospitality, protection, and seasonal celebration. Its names vary by region kolam (Tamil Nadu), muggulu (Andhra/Telangana), alpana (Bengal), mandana (Rajasthan/Madhya Pradesh), pookkalam (Kerala, flower rangoli) but the core concept is shared: drawing order and beauty onto the ground as a daily or ceremonial ritual.

        Materials range from rice flour, ground limestone, and red ochre to colored powders, quartz sand, flower petals, turmeric, kumkum, pulses, and even lamp soot. Using pinched fingers, cones, sieves, or stencils, makers outline and fill motifs that can be geometric (grids, dots-and-lines, mandalas), floral (lotus, creepers, peacocks), narrative (deity symbols, lamps), or abstract radiating forms. In southern dot-grid traditions, designs are “woven” by connecting points into symmetric lacework; in flower rangoli, petal colors are layered like mosaics. Lamps (diyas) are often placed within the design during evening rituals, turning the artwork into a luminous altar.

       Beyond decoration, rangoli carries practical and symbolic dimensions. Rice or cereal powders historically fed small creatures, an ethic of coexistence; alkaline limestone at thresholds helped deter insects. The act itselfdrawn freehand with steady, bent-knee postures functions as a daily meditative practice. While many households create small, everyday patterns, elaborate festival rangoli can be collaborative, large-scale, and richly colored, sometimes incorporating 3D shading or mixed media.

Contemporary expressions include pre-mixed, non-toxic powders, reusable stencils, and community installations in public spaces, hotels, and schools. Quality indicators are clean lines, symmetry, balanced color contrast, and a coherent center-outward flow that suits the site. Whether ephemeral or preserved for days, rangoli is living design, an art of presence and place that turns thresholds into symbols of welcome, order, and joy.
